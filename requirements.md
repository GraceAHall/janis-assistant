# Requirements

Random collection of requirements, not organised in any particular fashion:


## Files

Recognise different file systems:

- Local
- Remote (HPC)
- FTP
- HTTP
- S3
- GCP


Understand how to copy these files to the system this runs on, if required.

### Output filenames

Allow user to specify a map of the outputs, to new files names (with respect to extension requirements).

- Might need to do something special for secondary files re CWL vs WDL


### Validation

Probably schedule a job back to Cromwell
