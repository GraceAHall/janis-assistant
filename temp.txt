 - the background of the talk. 
 - Could be to give a brief description of their company (what, why, how) and their role

Melbourne Bioinformatics 
- Training (workshops, MC-SCIBIF)
- Connection: linking you to bioinformatian with experience in your field
- Advice on research design, data analysis 
- Bioinformatics collaboration / services for research projects
- Developing & administrating software platforms - Galaxy, Janis, other biocommons projects


Software Engineering within Bioinformatics - Pathways, Current State, Future Directions

I am a Bioinformatician & Software Engineer at Melbourne Bioinformatics. 
In this Q&A talk, I will discuss the pathway which lead me to my current position. 
I will also share some insight into the type of work performed by software engineers within bioinformatics, 
as well as the current state of Research Software Engineers (RSEs) in this field. 
To finish, I will briefly share my thoughts on the future direciton of RSE work within bioinformatics, and will hazard a guess as to how AI will affect this field.

Melbourne Bioinformatics provides a range of functions at the University of Melbourne. 
Aside from providing training workshops, contributing to the MC-SCIBIF course, and our involvement in the Galaxy project, we provide bioinformatics services to research groups. This involves consultation on research design and the data analysis required for a given project, as well as collaborating on projects if needed. Melbourne bioinformatics also functions to connect researchers to an external bioinformatian with experience in their field. 



How does my story apply to other people? 
- Do what you like to do 
- This will mean you're dedicated & motivated
- Lots of evidence to support that becoming an 'expert' is about time committed, rather than innate ability. 

AI?
- Research is actually a good place to be. AI tooling will make our work more productive.
- As a software engineer, I would be more in the firing line, but you still need to know what you're trying to accomplish. 
- At the end of the day, software engineers ship features & products, not code. 
- User doesn't care about the code. Its your job as a RSE to use any tools available to generate code which accomplishes your goal. 
- Might compare it to c vs python - single line of python might be dozens if not hundreds of c. 
- People use python because it accomplishes their goal faster than c. 
- My manager recently said something that stuck :
- "the goal of research is to put yourself out of a job"
- yet research still exists.
- For the forseeable future, will still need people to guide research efforts.
